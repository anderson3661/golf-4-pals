                            <p>After a 6 month gap since the last round of the 2007 Order of Merit (which itself took 3 years to complete) the 2010 Order of Merit kicked off at Mannings Heath.</p>
                            <p>Emerging victorious after a solid round was <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span>, who scored a very commendable 36 Stableford points.  Playing off 20, he made 4 pars, and had only 2 blobs.</p>
                            <p>Bishop was in fact 2 points behind runner-up <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span> at the turn, and 4 points behind after the 13th, but a strong finish by Bishop, and a poor finish by Anderson, proved decisive.</p>
                            <p>After starting so brightly, Anderson was disappointed to have 3 of his 4 blobs on the back nine, costing him victory.  Anderson made the only birdie of the day (at the par 4 11th) and 4 pars.</p>
                            <p>The current joint Order of Merit winners <span><strong>Steve Pearce</strong></span> and <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span> occupied 3rd and 4th places respectively.</p>
                            <p>Pearce started off in spectacular fashion with 4 pars in the first 5 holes, as well as a nearest the pin at the 5th, but couldn’t quite maintain that standard of play, despite eventually finishing with 7 pars, the most of all the players.</p>
                            <p>Fergus, playing off 16, scored a commendable 6 pars, but 4 blobs proved expensive.</p>

                            <p>A low scoring affair at Cottesmore saw <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> record a 2nd consecutive victory to give him a big early lead in the 2010 Order of Merit.</p>
                            <p>Despite failing to score on the first 3 holes (3 of 5 blobs in all), Bishop's round included 6 pars and a nearest the pin on the 8th, and he really dominated proceedings on the back nine.</p>

                            <p>Pearce had an uncharacteristically poor round, making 4 pars but also having 4 blobs.  Despite leading at the turn he, like Fergus and Anderson, really struggled on the back nine.</p>
                            <p>Fergus also had 4 pars and 4 blobs, but 6 one point holes (mostly double bogeys) proved expensive.</p>
                            <p>Anderson, like Bishop, also blobbed the first 3 holes, and never really recovered from that, with 3 more blobs in his round.</p>

                            <p><span><strong>Steve Pearce</strong></span> continued his excellent recent record at Rookwood with his 4th successive victory there, pipping <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span> on the 18th to win by a point.  Despite winning, it certainly wasn't one of Pearce's best rounds at Rookwood, scoring only 30 points.</p>
                            <p>Pearce’s round was solid, making 5 pars, including 4 on his favourite front nine, although 3 blobs was uncharacteristically high.</p>
                            <p>Anderson’s round was very inconsistent, making the day’s only birdie (on the short par 4 9th), 3 pars and 2 nearest the pins, but 6 blobs proved very costly.</p>
                            <p>Disappointing rounds from <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> and <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span>, saw current Order of Merit leader Bishop beating Fergus by a point, thanks to a par on the par 4 17th.</p>
                            <p>Bishop, like Anderson, had 5 pars and 6 blobs in his round.</p>
                            <p>Fergus made 3 pars and a nearest the pin, but 5 blobs (including 4 in a poor back nine) cost him dear.</p>
                            <p>Despite Pearce's victory, Bishop stays as the early leader in the 2010 Order of Merit with 16 points, 3 points ahead of Pearce, with Anderson 3 points further back.</p>

                            <p>Current Order of Merit leader <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> continued his amazing start to the season with his 3rd victory in the first 4 rounds, after a topsy-turvy low-scoring contest.</p>
                            <p>Standing on the 18th tee, Bishop was 2 points behind eventual runner-up <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span>, but an excellent par 5 by Bishop and a blob from Fergus secured Bishop's victory.</p>
                            <p>Bishop's round included 5 pars and 3 blobs, and after being 3rd at the turn, and then last after the 13th (having blobbed the 12th and 13th), his strong finish with 3 pars in the last 5 holes proved decisive.</p>
                            <p>Fergus made 2 excellent birdies at the 5th and 14th (both par 5s), but 4 blobs proved to be one too many.</p>
                            <p><span><strong>Steve Pearce</strong></span> finished in 3rd from <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span>, thanks to Anderson blobbing the last 3 holes (3 of 6 in all).</p>
                            <p>Pearce's round was relatively uneventful, with 3 pars and 4 blobs.</p>

Anderson again showed his liking for the players’ home course, with his 3rd victory in only 4 Order of Merit rounds they have played there.</p>
                            <p>Anderson’s round included 6 pars, 3 of which were made at the 16th, 17th and 18th, and only 1 blob.</p>

                            <p>Four pars in the last 5 holes secured Fergus’s victory, having taken the lead from runner-up <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> on the 17th.  Fergus had 6 pars in all, including 5 in an impressive back nine, and still managed 2 blobs.</p>
                            <p>Bishop had a solid round, the highlight of which was 4 consecutive pars from the 5th to the 8th holes; however, 3 blobs probably cost him the winners spot.  Nevertheless, Bishop's runner-up spot saw him extend his lead over <span><strong>Steve Pearce</strong></span> to 9 points in the 2010 Order of Merit.</p>
                            <p>Despite a blob free round, Pearce only managed to score 31 points to finish in 3rd place.  Although Pearce made 5 pars, too many 1 point holes (8 in all) proved costly.</p>

                commentary: `
                            <p>In glorious conditions <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span> secured the perfect start to the 2007 campaign with victory at Rookwood.  On another hot sunny day the ground was hard and the greens not receptive, but all 4 players scored over 30 points to start the 2007 season in positive fashion.<p>
                            <p>After 7 weeks off to savour his 2006 triumph, Fergus showed no signs of early season rustiness, as in snap-happy mood and playing off only 20, he scored a brilliant 25 points on the front nine including a run of 4 pars and a birdie (par 3 8th) from the 5th to the 9th. Handicap preservation, tiredness or shock was in evidence on the back nine with only 13 points scored, but it was enough for an excellent return of 38 points, to win by 1 point and a great start.  There were also 2 NTPs at the 8th and 16th.  The only negative for Fergus was the post-round realisation that a handicap of 20 or over may not be seen again for the forseeable future.</p>
                            <p>Perennial runner-up <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span> started the season by finishing runner-up!  Nevertheless it was a pleasing start for Anderson who, playing off 15, shot 8 pars and only 1 blob for a round of 86 and a credible return of 37 points.</p> 
                            <p>Mirroring the final positions of the 2006 season, <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> pipped <span><strong>Steve Pearce</span></strong> to finish in 3rd position with 32 points.  Playing off 20, an inconsistent round witnessed a birdie (par 4 6th), an NTP (11th), 3 pars and 4 blobs.  However, Bishop will be pleased to have snatched 3rd place from Pearce, having started his round with only 6 points from the first 5 holes, putting him well behind the others.</p>
                            <p>Bringing up the rear again was a misfiring Pearce who, playing off 15, started brightly with 19 points on the front nine, but blew up on the back nine and finished with only 5 points from the last 6 holes.  Recent regular midweek golf at Hill Barn with guru Kevin Black appeared to have offered Pearce a solution to his 2006 woes, but on this showing 2007 promises little better!</p>

                            <p>In extremely blustery conditions <span><strong>Steve Pearce</strong></span> finally broke an 18 round winless jinx by finishing joint winner with <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span> who extended his incredible winning streak at Chichester to 6 after a stunning comeback.  After 4 topsy-turvy rounds all 4 players were amazingly separated at the end by only one point.<p>
                            <p>Heavy rain all week incredibly subsided on Saturday and the showers forecast didn't materialise, probably blown away by a very strong wind.  This made shot selection difficult and all of the players struggled at times.  The winning score was only 30 points at a normally high scoring course.<p>
                            <p>Playing off less that 20 for the first time since August 2005, defending champion and early Order of Merit leader Fergus struggled early on and was well behind leaders Pearce and <span><strong>Martin Anderson</span></strong> after 13 holes.  However a great run of 3 successive pars at holes 14,15 and 16 coincided with poor play from Pearce and Anderson, and a great run of 3 pars in 4 holes by Bishop to leave only 2 points between all 4 going up the last with Fergus and Anderson tied for the lead.  A bogey at the 18th was enough for Fergus to tie with Pearce who parred the last.  Pearce had a steady, if unspectaclar round, but as he admitted afterwards jointly winning could be just what was required to turn round his recent patchy form.</p>
                            <p>Finishing in joint third position on 29 points, only a point behind, were <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> and Anderson.  After parring the first hole (with a nearest the pin) Bishop had an horrendous run of only 11 points in 12 holes to look well out of contention.  However, another nearest the pin at the 14th was the catalyst for a brilliant finish with 4 pars in the last 5 holes, scoring 15 points, more then he had scored in the previous 13 holes.  Anderson had an inconsistent round with only 1 blob but also only 3 pars; some good putting managing to rescue some points after some wayward driving.</p>

                            <p>A damp, still, grey day witnessed a classic battle between heavyweights <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> and current champion and Order of Merit leader <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span>, finishing in a tie on 36 points.  It was also a day for the statisticians with 3 birdies and 5 nearest the pins.<p>
                            <p>A good performance by Bishop, fresh from an Exiles Golf Society meeting at East Brighton, saw him record his first victory (albeit joint) of the season.  Two goods pars in the first 2 holes were followed by 2 blobs putting Bishop behind Fergus and <span><strong>Steve Pearce</span></strong> at the turn.  However a great par at the stroke index 1 10th, followed by another par at the long par 3 11th after a fantastic tee shot, and then another 3 points at the stroke index 2 12th saw Bishop leapfrog into the lead and it was nip and tuck from then on with Fergus.  Tied going down the 18th both players had their chances but both made 6 to finish as joint winners.
                            <p>Fergus continued his impressive start to the season to record his 3rd win in the 3 starts.  Incredibly it was Fergus's 9th victory in the last 13th Order of Merit rounds.  Fergus again played very steadily with only 1 blob, the highlight being a birdie on the long par 5 9th hole.  He also held his game together manfully after the onslaught by Bishop, where in previous seasons he probably would have folded.</p>
                            <p>Finishing in third place was Pearce after another promising but ultimately disappointing round.  Fresh from an 82 at Hill Barn in practice, Pearce hit the ground running with 3 successive pars followed by another at the 5th.  However, typical of his erratic form from last season, Pearce then only scored 10 points in the next 10 holes to put him out of contention.  A great birdie at the 16th (Pearce's first in 11 rounds) followed by par at the 17th gave Pearce some consolation, to finish with 32 points.  Unfortunately Pearce forgot his golf shoes and had to play in a borrowed pair that were a size to big, and this undoubtedly prayed on Pearce's mind during the round.</p>
                            <p>Bringing up the rear and leaving him bottom of the Order of Merit was <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span>.  A trip to Brussels and an uncharacteristic late night the day before led to a lucklustre performance, with a birdie at the 15th and 2 excellent hot chocolates in the clubhouse the only highlights for Anderson.</p>

Forecast heavy rain luckily never materialised and the round was played in remarkably good conditions with relatively little wind for the Dyke.  The round was started off the 10th because of time contraints.<p>
                            <p>Pearce started the round playing well within himself and 19 points at the turn was a deserved return for some consistent golf.  The back nine was not quite as good, but victory was never really in doubt by the 12th, and 2 good nearest the pins at the 5th and 8th (i.e. 14th and 17th for the round) capped a solid performance.</p>
                            <p>Finishing in second place was <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> albeit with only 27 points.  The highlight of a mixed round was an excellent nearest the pin at the long 17th.</p>

After intermittent showers for the first 5 holes, the heavens opened on the 6th tee resulting in the players having to shelter under trees for 30 minutes.

                            <p>With all 4 players getting similar scores to last time out at the Dyke, Pearce was again steady, if unspectacular, with only one blob in the first 15 holes.  The highlight of the round was an excellent run of 5 pars in 6 holes from the 10th onwards on the difficult C course.  Pearce also recorded 2 nearest the pins, on the 11th and the tricky 15th.

Bishop promised more after 6 pars in the first 11 holes, leaving him 3 points ahead of Pearce, but a disappointing return of only 4 points in the last 7 holes ultimately cost Bishop victory.  A nearest the pin at the 2nd left Bishop just one behind Pearce in the NTP competition.</p>

                            <p>After last season's woes, <span><strong>Steve Pearce</strong></span> continued his recent good run of success with another solid performance (36 points) and win on a nice day at Rookwood.  Incredibly all players more or less finished in the same positions for the 4th successive round.<p>
                            <p>Pearce started like a train with 5 pars and a birdie (also an NTP at the short 8th) to record a 2 over par front 9 scoring 23 points.  Only one par was recorded on the back 9, but all 4 players struggled on the back 9 and Pearce finished comfortably ahead.</p>
                            <p><span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> finished 2nd again with a steady 33 points, an improvement on his last 3 rounds, although with only 2 pars and 1 birdie (again at the short 8th).</p>
                            <p>2006 champion <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span> also improved on his previous few rounds to score 30 points and secure 3rd place.  However, the consistent form of 2006 seems to have completely deserted Fergus, and he really needs to question his motivation and tackle the apparent complacency that has slipped into his game in order to return to winning ways.</p>
                            <p>As for <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span> what can you say?  Another poor return of 26 points (despite back-to-back birdies on the 8th and 9th) means Anderson is in his worst run of form since the Order of Merit started in 2004.  Perhaps an extended period in Geneva will help sort out Anderson's mind ... and swing !!!</p>

                            <p>The first Major of the season (only decided after the players had hit their first tee shots) witnessed a joyful return to winning ways for Geneva-based <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span>, finally bringing to an end <span><strong>Steve Pearce's</span></strong> recent run of success.  Anderson won with only 30 points and highlighted that at this level it is just as important to keep the blobs off the card as it is to score impressively.  Anderson scored less pars (only 3) than all of the other players, but with only 2 blobs it was enough to end his recent drought.  However, Anderson's questionable tactic of turning up only 5 minutes before the round seemed to have an unsettling effect on the other players; as a result of which Anderson may face disciplinary action.<p>
                            <p><span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> made it 5 second places on the spin, snatching it from the others with a good par at the 18th.  An unspectacular round saw 4 pars, but 5 blobs were Bishop's downfall.  Nevertheless Bishop will be pleased with another 2nd place, especially with double position points, meaning he is now only 5 points away from Order of Merit leader Pearce.  Bishop adopted an unusual tactic of hitting the ball just off the teeing area on several holes to leave him with long second shots, but he may need to reconsider this tactic if he wants to win the Order of Merit.</p>
                            <p>For in-form Pearce it was a well below par performance.  Despite chipping in on the 9th for a birdie three, Pearce really struggled throughout the round, not helped by some uncharacteristically wayward driving.  Even the golfing gods tried to help him by consistently 'throwing' the ball back on to the fairway after driving into the trees, but on the day it wasn't enough to save Pearce, who saw his lead at the top of the Order of Merit cut back by Bishop.</p>
                            <p>Bringing up the rear, fresh from a reported 2 over par back nine at Hill Barn only the week before, was 2006 champion <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span>.  It was a day of extremes for Fergus, with 4 pars, a good birdie on the par 3 third and 2 nearest the pins being more than offset by 8 (eight) blobs.  Fergus will be especialy disappointed as he was lying in 2nd position on the 18th tee with a par giving him a chance of tying for first place with Anderson after Anderson's errant tee shot.  However a poor second shot following an excellent drive caused Fergus to blob the hole and this really opitimized his round; some wayward second shots after excellent tee shots ruining his scorecard.</p>

                            <p>After an absence of nearly 2 months, the Order of Merit resumed on a lovely warm, still November day at West Chiltington, with <span><strong>Steve Pearce</strong></span> winning to continue his quest for his 3rd Order of Merit title.<p>
                            <p>However the day was marred by some ugly events which has thrown the society into turmoil.  Firstly a spat between Pearce and <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> erupted on the 14th after Pearce played the wrong ball, after dubious information given by Bishop.<p>
                            <p>Then <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span> was extremely annoyed on the 18th fairway after shanking his 4th shot seemingly out of bounds.  Fergus contested that it was out of bounds, and seemed annoyed by the other players reactions to his misfortune (or rather lack of ability).  Maybe cries of "You big Scottish shanker" made in the heat of battle were misinterpreted by Fergus!<p>
                            <p>However, the biggest controversy occured in the scoring tent after the game.  On checking the scores, chairman <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span> has discovered what appears to be a discrepancy with Fergus's score which throws the whole result in doubt.  Anderson marked down 6 for 2 on the long 8th for Fergus, but this should be 6 for 1.  This means Fergus would tie with Anderson for last place.  Anderson requires confirmation of Fergus's score from Fergus and/or Pearce and Bishop.<p>
                            <p>In terms of the actual round, it was pretty close all the way round, with Pearce just edging it at the end.  A run of 3 pars on 15, 16 and 17 was enough to clinch it for Pearce; 2 nearest the pins were the icing on the cake.  It was Pearce's 6th win in 9 Order of Merit starts.  For the other 3 it all came down to the 18th with Bishop coming out on top to clinch, incredibly, his 6th successive 2nd place.</p>

                            <p>A superb birdie 4 on the long par 5 17th was the deciding factor in a closely fought encounter at Gatton Manor.  <span><strong>Martin Anderson</span></strong> hit 3 brilliant shots down the 524 yard hole and sunk a one foot putt for his birdie.  It was Anderson's 2nd win in the last 3 starts and although still languishing at the bottom of the OOM table at the half way stage, gives him hope for a continued recovery during the 2nd half of the season.  His score of 35 points was his best return since the opening round of the season.  The weather was largely dry and the course was damp, without being sodden after heavy rain during the week.<p>
                            <p>It was close throughout the round between Anderson, <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span> and OOM leader <span><strong>Steve Pearce</span></strong>, with Fergus eventually clinching 2nd place.  It was also Fergus's best points score since May, with 5 pars and a good birdie on the par 5 5th.  It also enabled Fergus to tie for 2nd place with <span><strong>Dave Bishop</span></strong> in the overall Order of Merit.<p>
                            <p>Although finishing 3rd, OOM leader Pearce increased his lead at the top of the table to 11 points.  Pearce was again at his steady best with only 1 bogey, and Pearce has now scored between 30 to 36 points in 9 of the 10 rounds this season.<p>
                            <p>As for <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> the less said the better.  Bishop's run of 6 successive 2nd places was brought to a crashing end after scoring the lowest points return of the season (19).  And this after a good birdie on the par 3 2nd !!<p>

Played in largely sunny conditions with one shower, it was Pearce's 7th victory in the 11 starts, but it was easily his best performance of the season.  Two excellent birdies at the par 4 3rd and par 3 8th were impressive, but to top that Pearce was nearest the pin on all 4 par 3s, a first for the competition, and a quite fantastic achievement.<p>

After a bright start by <span><strong>Steve Pearce</span></strong>, and despite pressure from <span><strong>Jack Fergus</span></strong> until near the end, it was <span><strong>Martin Anderson's</strong></span> day, as in the end he comfortably secured his 3rd victory in the last 5 starts and edged ever closer to moving off the bottom of the Order of Merit table.  In the end it was down to the number of bogeys scored, and Anderson's 3 was comfortably less than the other players.  The highlight of the day was a wonderful birdie on the difficult 17th, after a solid drive and superb 2nd shot, leaving a 6 foot birdie putt.<p>
                            <p>In a tight finish for 2nd place, Fergus edged out Pearce by one point.  Fergus's round was inconsistent at best, the highlights being an excellent birdie on the par 4 13th, and a nearest the pin on the 11th.  However, whilst at times, Fergus's short game was on song, other parts of his game badly let him down.  Fergus's birdie also put him to the top of the most birdies in the season table.<p>
                            <p>Despite his worst points return of the season, it wasn't too bad a day for current Order of Merit leader Pearce as he maintained his 16 point lead.  After starting brightly, Pearce never really mentally recovered from blobs at 6 and 7, which Pearce largely put down to pre-tournament gardening !<p>
                            <p>Again <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> will want to forget the round, as he recorded the season's lowest of 18 points, beating his own record he had set only 2 rounds before.  In a par-less round there were basically no highlights !<p>
                            <p>And so with 60% of the season gone, Pearce's position looks pretty formidable, with the others slugging it out for 2nd place.  However, with 3 Majors still to play, and as Pearce hasn't won a Major since 2004, all is still to play for.<p>

Amazingly it was in August 2004 that Mannings was last played (it seems like only a couple of years ago!).  The winner that day was <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span> with 44 points playing off 22, but on this occasion <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span> was victorious in a close run thing.  Anderson's 6 pars were just enough to ward off the others, and gave Anderson back to back victories and more importantly leapfrogged him into 2nd place in the Order of Merit.<p>
                            <p>Finishing in 2nd place was <span><strong>Steve Pearce</strong></span> who maintained his very healthy lead in the Order of Merit and who must be feeling very confident of sealing his 3rd Order of Merit title out of the 4 played.

                            <p>Bringing up the rear was veteran Fergus, who, with plenty of time now on his hands having recently taken retirement, decided not to spend any of it on the driving range.

On the front nine, Pearce recorded 8 pars and a bogey (on the short 8th) and kept his excellent round going until the last few holes; however he still managed to get 12 pars in total, including pars on the first 7 holes; surely a record.

                            <p>In joint 3rd place, a long way behind, finished Bishop and Pearce.  Both players struggled throughout the round; Bishop's 2 nearest-the-pins being the only highlight.  Pearce's lead in the race for the Order of Merit was dramatically cut from 19 to 13 points, but with only 2 rounds left he he is going to need to have 2 more disasters to lose his hold on the crown; probably an unrealistic prospect.<p>
                            <p>An interesting statistic from this season (albeit played over 3 years !) is that there have been only 5 rounds where more than 36 Stableford points have been scored; and all of those have been at Rookwood.  Perhaps a review of player's handicaps is required before next season!<p>

                            <p>It was no surprise that a return to his favourite neck of the woods saw <span><strong>Jack Fergus's</strong></span> 4th consecutive Order of Merit victory,  which sets up an intriguing last round in the extended 2007 Order of Merit.  The last round will see long time leader <span><strong>Steve Pearce</span></strong> only 8 points ahead of Fergus, his massive lead having been reduced by 17 points in the last 5 rounds.  <span><strong>Martin Anderson</span></strong> also goes into the last round, a Major, 11 points behind Pearce which at least gives him the chance of a miraculous victory.<p>
                            <p>The player's second visit to Bognor Regis saw a hot sunny day, apart from a rainy first 10 minutes, but the day got off to a bad start when the club-shop pro would not allow <span><strong>Dave Bishop</span></strong> and Anderson to play with pockets on the sides of their shorts.  Bishop decided to spash out on some shorts, and then very kindly lent his waterproof trousers to Anderson.<p>
                            <p>Incredibly it was Fergus's 9th consecutive victory at Chichester Tower/Bognor Regis, stretching over a 5 year period.  This time a steady round of only 31 points was enough to secure another victory.<p>
                            <p>Finishing in 2nd place was Anderson, just 1 point ahead of Bishop and 2 ahead of Pearce.  After a poor start of 3 blobs in the first 6 holes, 2nd place was a good result for Anderson and kept his dreams of a first Order of Merit victory just about alive.<p>
                            <p>In 3rd place finished Bishop.  Fresh from scoring 39 points and winning Slinfold with the Exiles, a lot was expected of Bishop, but again he failed to deliver.  Two nearest the pins were the highlights of his round.<p>
                            <p>Finishing in last place was Order of Merit leader Pearce who again had a disappointing round.  After 8 victories in the first 14 rounds, Pearce hasn't now won in 5 which has put a bit of a dampener on his likely 3rd Order of Merit success.<p>

A brilliant round by Fergus, scoring 37 points, allowed saw to score enough OOM points to tie with long time OOM leader Pearce.<p>
                            <p>The Order of Merit rules state that in the event of a tie the number of individual victories is taken into account, but with 8 each the two players cannot be separated and therefore they finish joint winners !!!<p>
                            <p>Going into the round Fergus was required to produce something special to catch Pearce's 8 point lead in the Order of Merit, and he certainly delivered.  Fergus's round included a birdie (par 4 4th), 5 pars, a nearest-the-pin, and only 1 blob, and he led all the way after his birdie on the 4th.</p>
                            <p>Pearce had a very disappointing day, only scoring 24 points (including 4 pars and 5 blobs) to finish 3rd, but the 2 Order of Merit points for finishing 3rd and the 1 point for scoring 24 proved crucial.</p>
                            <p><span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> finished runner-up for the round, scoring a disappointing 25 points, which meant he finished 4th in the Order of Merit.</p>
                            <p>Finishing in last place was Anderson after a desparately disappointing round; the highlight being an excellent birdie 3 on the 16th.<p>
                            <p>And so the end to a topsy-turvy season.  Fergus started strongly by winning the first 3 rounds, followed by 4 on the spin from Pearce.  The next 8 were shared by Pearce and Anderson, which meant that Pearce looked to be the odds on winner after 14 rounds. However, Fergus then proceeded to win all of the last 5 rounds to complete a remarkable comeback.</p>
                            <p>The joint winning score of 96 points was comfortably the lowest in the history of the Order of Merit, which probably reflects the extended period over which it was played, primarily due to Anderson's work commitments.</p>
                            <p>Pearce set a new record for nearest-the-pins over the season with a highly impressive 21.</p>

                            <p>It was Bishop’s 3rd win in the last 4 rounds, his round including only 3 pars, but two of them significantly were made at the 16th and 18th to secure victory.</p>
                            <p>In the runner-up spot, just a point behind Bishop, was <span><strong>Steve Pearce</strong></span> who had the day’s only birdie (at the par 5 3rd), as well as 4 pars.</p>
                            <p><span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span> finished in 3rd place, a strong finish on the last 4 holes not quite being enough to catch the leaders after a poor front nine.<p>
                            </p>Current 2006 Order of Merit leader, <span><strong>Martin Anderson</strong></span>, was a disappointing 4th after leading at the turn and scoring 5 pars overall; however, 3 blobs on the back nine proved to be very costly.</p>
                            <p>At the half way stage of the 2006 Order of Merit, Anderson has a clear lead, 15 points ahead of Fergus, 17 ahead of Pearce, and 22 ahead of Bishop.  However, with 3 Majors still to play, and 2004 and 2005 winner Pearce likely to return to form, everything is still up for grabs.</p>

                            <p>Conditions were perfect for the time of year, with warm sunshine, although underfoot it was wet and extremely muddy in places resulting in some tricky conditions from just off the greens.</p>

Fergus didn't seem to be able to cope with a handicap cut to 21 and was always just slightly behind the leaders.

                            <p>The 3rd Major took place in damp conditions after heavy overnight and early morning rain, although only the occasional shower dampened the day.  The round was originally booked for Tilgate, but was switched to Goodwood at the last minute after hearing that tee mats were in operation at Tilgate.</p>
                            <p>Fergus played consistently well from start to finish, scoring an 87, with 43 Stableford points, 7 pars and all 3 nearest the pins, and this after the Committee had generously increased his handicap to 22 after a disappointing round a fortnight ago.  An interesting decision regarding Fergus's future handicap awaits.</p>
                            <p>Incredibly this was Fergus's 3rd Major win of the season, and with the Grand Slam and Order of Merit in sight, a nail-biting end to the season is in prospect.  However, how will Fergus cope with the off the field pressures following the shocking revelations about wife Anne's preference for legendary deceased comedian Bob Hope in the bedroom ?</p>
                            <p>It was a disappointing day for Anderson, who was inconsistent in all aspects of his game, in particular missing some short putts at crucial stages of the round.  Anderson's frustration turned to anger on the 17th following Fergus's 3rd wayward tee shot in 4 holes, which finished so far off target that it left him on the wrong fairway, but with a good lie.</p>
                            <p>Finishing in 2nd place on 34 points was <span><strong>Steve Pearce</span></strong>, who is beginning to show signs of recapturing the consistency that made him Order of Merit winner for the past two seasons.  Crucially he made up 6 points on <span><strong>Dave Bishop</span></strong> to trail by only 5 for the wooden spoon.  The extra point he gained 'for turning-up' following injury at West Chiltington in December may yet prove contentious.</p>
                            <p>Bringing up the rear was a disappointed Bishop who, following par at the 6th and birdie at the 7th (the day's only birdie), faded badly on the back nine.</p>
                            <p>Shot of the day has to go to Fergus's tee shot on the long par 3 11th.  After pulling 2 points back on Fergus at the 10th, Anderson hit a brilliant tee shot on the 11th to within 12 feet.  However, under extreme pressure Fergus took wood off the tee and hit to within 6 feet.  Close runner-up was Bishop's 20 yard chip in on the 7th for birdie.</p>

                            <p>An unprecedented 5th successive victory at Chichester put <span><strong>Jack Fergus</strong></span> on the brink of winning his first Order of Merit after a hard-earned victory.  This was Fergus's 3rd win at Chichester this season following wins in 2005 and 2004.</p>
                            <p>Conditions overhead were grey but very mild, although a lot of standing water on the course following heavy rain in the last couple of weeks, made scoring slightly more difficult than normal.  The majority of bunkers were almost completely filled with water.</p>
                            <p>All 4 players had an inconsistent round, with Fergus eventually triumphing with only 31 points ... a very disappointing return from high-scoring Chichester.</p>
                            <p>Fergus continued his impressive recent form, and secured his 6th win in the last 9 Order of Merit rounds.  A handicap cut of 2 to 20 looked too much in the early stages and Fergus struggled to only 3 points from the opening 4 holes.  Fergus then brilliantly turned his round around with 3 successive pars (scoring 10 points) to catch up early leader <span><strong>Steve Pearce</span></strong>.  Consistent golf from then on put Fergus steadily ahead before a late wobble with 3 successive blobs meant all was to play for down the 18th.  Fergus held his nerve and a par left him with a hard-earned, but crucial victory.</p>
                            <p>Pearce finished in 2nd place for the 3rd successive occasion, making it <strong>16</strong> events since his last Order of Merit win; a dismal statistic from the 2005 and 2004 champion.  Pearce looked destined to end his barren spell by parring 5 of the first 6 holes to put him 6 points ahead of the nearest challenger.  However, an errant tee shot on the 7th followed by an overly ambitious recovery shot led to Pearce's game collapsing and 13 points from the final 12 holes was scant reward for the early promise.</p>
                            <p><span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span> did well to recover from a poor front nine to finish in 3rd place but won't have been happy in only scoring 28 points.  Bishop's woes started on the first green, when after a good tee shot to hit the centre of the green for nearest the pin, he somehow managed to <strong>FIVE</strong> putt from only 20 yards.  Five other blobs were mixed with five pars and meant Bishop finished with the best back nine (16 points) to only just miss out on the top two places.</p>
                            <p>Having led the Order of Merit for most of the season, <span><strong>Martin Anderson's</strong></span> season looks to be ending on a low, finishing last on the day and only scoring 27 points.  Steady, if unspectacular, golf meant Anderson was in a three way tie for the lead at the half way stage, but some poor driving and putting caused him to fade on the back nine.  The heady days of mid-summer practise now seem a long way off and Anderson needs a miracle to have any hopes of overtaking Fergus.</p>
                            <p><span><strong>Shot of the day</strong></span> was Pearce's tee shot at the par 3 third hole.  Starting the ball off just right of the pin, a bit of draw saw the ball head straight at the flag, pitching and stopping just a couple of feet to the left of and behind the pin.  Unfortunately Pearce missed a tricky downhill putt for a birdie.</p>

Fergus managed to fight off the challenge of <span><strong> Martin Anderson</strong></span> who, although winning on the day and depriving Fergus of the grand slam of Majors, could nevertheless not stop him winning the ultimate prize.<p>
                            <p>The final round, and Major, of the season saw anticipated showers never materialise and so was played in largely sunny conditions, although a blustery wind and exceptionally wet conditions underfoot, made play slow and scoring difficult.  The 100-150 yard walk from green to tee on most holes (largely uphill and slippery), added to the difficulty.</p>
                            <p>The battle for the Wooden Spoon witnessed a dramatic turnaround after <span><strong> Steve Pearce</strong></span>, who had led for most of the round, collapsed in the last 3 holes and was therefore unable to score enough points to overhaul the misfiring <span><strong>Dave Bishop</strong></span>, who had a nightmare of a round to record the lowest ever Stableford points total, beating by one Fergus's record of 13 at Rusper in 2004.  Bishop later commented that he was disappointed because he wanted to win something !!</p> 
                            <p>Pearce took the early lead although there was never much in it between him, Anderson and Fergus until the latter stages.  It was clear from very early on that Anderson, needing to score over 36 Stableford points to stand any chance of winning the overall Order of Merit, was never going to do that, and so with the pressure off Fergus the battle was really about who could win on the day.  Anderson just did enough to win with 6 pars, Fergus again played steadily, Pearce again promised more than he ultimately delivered, and Bishop just had one of those days.</p>
                            <p><span><strong>Shot of the day</strong></span> was Pearce's tee shot at the par 3 seventeenth hole.  Although only 159 yards off the tee, a stiff breeze meant the hole played several clubs longer.  Pearce took a 5 wood and with a low draw finished only 20 yards from the pin.  On the day it was the only shot on any of the four par 3s that finished on the green.  It also saw Pearce top the nearest the pin table for the season.</p>
                            <p><span><strong>Highlight of the day</strong></span> has to be Mr Bishop's remark about Shaun Wright-Phillips father which had everyone in stitches.  Thanks again to Mr Bishop for driving; it turned out to be quite a distance; still it was nice to see him driving straight !!  The course itself is definitely worth a revisit (especially at 2 for 1 prices), perhaps in better weather when the ball is running more.</p>
